                                            LAYOUTS

In a Ruby on Rails application, a view is a template that generates the HTML content to be displayed to
 the user. Views are typically associated with a specific controller action and are responsible for
 generating the content for that action. For example, if you have a PostsController with an index
action that displays a list of posts, you would have an index.html.erb view file that generates the HTML
 for displaying the list of posts.

A layout, on the other hand, is a template that defines the common structure of your pages.
Layouts typically include elements such as the page header, footer, and navigation menu that are
shared across multiple pages. When you render a view within a layout, the content of the view is
inserted into the layout at the location of the yield statement.

 The main difference between a view and a layout is their purpose: views generate the content specific
to a particular controller action, while layouts define the common structure of your pages. By using
layouts, you can avoid duplicating common elements in each of your views and keep your code DRY
(Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself). Is there anything else you would like to know?

The Yield in the layout file allows for all of the content of the index view that's rendered to
 be inserted into it.

 The layout file will be rendered in all of the following views: new. html.erb, index.html.erb,
 show.html.erb.
