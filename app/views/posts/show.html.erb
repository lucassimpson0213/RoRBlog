    The state of technology in 2023 is quite interesting. According to a survey by Spiceworks Ziff Davis, 
  an overwhelming majority (83%) of companies are concerned about a recession in 2023. However, despite this concern, 
  roughly half (51%) of organizations plan to increase IT budgets in 2023, with only 6% planning to cut back on tech spending 

 
 In addition, Forbes has listed the top 10 tech trends for 2023. One of the most important trends is the increasing presence of 
AI in organizations. No-code AI will enable any business to leverage its power to create more intelligent products and services.
 Contactless, autonomous shopping and delivery will also be a huge trend for 2023
