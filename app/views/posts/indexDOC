            LANDING PAGE
On my landing page I used two parent containers with two individual child divs in them
I used the instance variable @post and the .each method to iterate through all of the posts and display
them on the screen placing the date div and title div in a parent container.
I used the link_to method which creates an anchor element that links to the post in question.
this calls the show method and and proceeds to call the corresponding post with it's ID.
